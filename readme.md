This lab assignment focuses on using Arduino and HTTP to report the state of LEDs to a webpage. The goal of this lab is to provide me with hands-on experience in programming and interfacing with electronic components using Arduino and to demonstrate how to use HTTP to communicate with web servers. The lab involves creating an Arduino sketch that sends HTTP requests to an API to report the state of three LEDs in the circuit.

Materials Required:

ESP32 board
Breadboard I
Three LEDs of different colors (Red, Green, and Blue)
Three 220Î© resistors
Jumper wires
USB cable
Computer with internet access

In this lab assignment, you learned how to use Arduino and HTTP to report the state of LEDs to a webpage. An Arduino /ESP32 sketch WAS CREATED that sends HTTP requests to an API to report the state of three LEDs in the circuit. You also learned how to verify that the request was successful and how to test the sketch using the tester site. This lab provided me with hands-on experience in programming and interfacing with electronic components using Arduino and demonstrated how to use HTTP to communicate with web servers.
